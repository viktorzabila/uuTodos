 * ----------------------
 * 1. PREAMBLE and Definitions
 *   1.1 These UAF Commercial License Terms ("UAF CLT") govern licensing of the Unicorn Application Framework (UAF).
 *     The Customer and Unicorn concluded an agreement for the provision of Solution that is using UAF or its parts
 *     (the "Agreement").
 *   1.2 The provisions of these UAF CLT shall govern the relationship between the Customer and Unicorn regarding
 *     the UAF License granted under the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in case of any conflict between these
 *     UAF CLT and the Agreement, the provisions of the Agreement always prevail.
 *   1.3 The "UAF Components", and each of them individually as "UAF Component", shall mean the components of the Unicorn
 *     Application Framework, which are listed and described in the Attachment I to these UAF CLT.
 *   1.4 "UAF" shall mean the Unicorn Application Framework the scope of which is described in Attachment I, including all
 *     associated documentation and preparatory design materials, in particular blueprints, models, user manuals,
 *     training materials, comprehensive instructions and guidelines for drafting, production, operation and maintenance of
 *     software solutions, reference architecture, ready-made components and tools, use cases and tutorials.
 *   1.5 The "Knowledge Base" shall mean the online materials, internet fora and other resources made available by Unicorn
 *     online with regard to the UAF, intended for the broad customer and developer community.
 *   1.6 The "License" shall mean the binding terms and conditions for use of the UAF by the Customer. The License is
 *     described in Clause 2 and may be further specified or modified by the Agreement.
 *   1.7 The "Solution" shall mean any product or service developed under the Agreement using the UAF or any of
 *     UAF Components or its other parts, further specified in the Agreement.
 * 2. LICENSE GRANT
 *   2.1 The Customer shall be hereby granted a non-exclusive and non-transferable worldwide license to use the UAF for
 *     the purpose of the Solution described in the Agreement. For this purpose, the Customer shall be entitled to modify
 *     the UAF and create derivative works based on the UAF.
 *   2.2 The Customer is entitled to grant third parties a sub-license allowing them to use the UAF or any derivative works
 *     based on the UAF under commercial terms of its choice, provided that:
 *     2.2.1 use of the UAF and any derivative works based on the UAF by third parties is limited to testing, handover and
 *       operation of the Solution or its use as a service,
 *     2.2.2 third parties are not entitled to use the UAF or any derivative works based on the UAF independently of
 *       the Solution,
 *     2.2.3 third parties are not provided access to source code of the UAF unless such right is granted by the Agreement
 *       or if they conclude a commercial license agreement with Unicorn.
 *   2.3 The Solution or its parts based on the UAF shall bear a prominent copyright notice "Based on Unicorn Application
 *     Framework Copyright (c) Unicorn" integrated
 *     2.3.1 in the graphical user interface of the Solution or its relevant part or
 *     2.3.2 in accompanying file if the Solution or its relevant part do not have graphical user interface or
 *     2.3.3 in Solution's documentation.
 *   2.4 The License shall be valid for the whole duration of copyright to the UAF, unless other duration of the License is
 *     specified in the Agreement.
 *   2.5 The Customer is entitled to access the Knowledge Base only if expressly agreed in the Agreement.
 *   2.6 The Unicorn retains all rights to the UAF not covered by the provisions of this Clause 2. Unless explicitly
 *     permitted by applicable law, the Customer may not use the UAF in any other way than provided by the provisions of
 *     this Clause 2 and may not allow such use on its behalf by any of its employees or agents.
 *   2.7 The price for the License is included in the price stipulated in the Agreement.
 * 3. MODIFICATIONS
 *   3.1 The Customer explicitly acknowledges that the UAF is under continuous development and any UAF Component or other
 *     part of the UAF may be modified, replaced or removed by the Unicorn from the UAF in any of its future versions.
 *   3.2 This License covers also any new version of UAF if some parts of the UAF are modified or replaced.
 *   3.3 If any part of the UAF is removed by Unicorn in any of its future versions, the License for such version of
 *     the UAF is reduced appropriately and covers only the remaining parts of UAF. Sub-licenses previously granted to
 *     third parties in accordance with Clause 2.2 remain unaffected.

 *     in Attachment I to these UAF CLT.
 * 5. NO TRADEMARK OR PATENT LICENSE

 *     THE CUSTOMER IN THE AGREEMENT.
 * 8. THIRD PARTY CLAIMS
 *   8.1 The Unicorn will defend or settle, at its option and expense, any action brought against the Customer in a member
 *     state of the European Union which concerns an allegation that the UAF provided infringes a patent or copyright or
 *     misappropriates a trade secret in such jurisdiction. The Unicorn shall pay costs and damages finally awarded against
 *     the Customer that are attributable to such action. The Customer declares to understand and agrees that following
 *     conditions must be fulfilled in order to make Unicorn's obligations under this Clause 8 effective and enforceable:
 *     The Customer must (a) notify Unicorn promptly in writing of the action or any reasonable threat of it,
 *     (b) provide the Unicorn with all reasonable information and assistance it will request to settle or defend the action, and
 *     (c) grant the Unicorn sole authority and control of the defense or settlement of the action.
 *   8.2 If a claim is made under Clause 8.1 the Unicorn may, at its sole option and expense:
 *     (a) replace or modify the UAF so that it becomes non-infringing,
 *     (b) procure for the Customer the right to continue using the UAF unmodified.
 *   8.3 The Unicorn shall not be held liable to the Customer if the action is based on:
 *     (a) the combination of UAF with any product not provided by Unicorn,
 *     (b) the modification of the UAF other than by Unicorn,
 *     (c) the use of other than a current unaltered release of the UAF,
 *     (d) a product that the Customer makes, uses, or sells,
 *     (e) infringement by the Customer that is deemed willful. In the case under (e) the Customer shall reimburse
 *     the Unicorn for its reasonable attorney fees and other costs related to the action.
 *   8.4 THIS CLAUSE IS SUBJECT TO CLAUSE 7 AND STATES UNICORN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY, CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY,
 *     FOR DEFENSE, SETTLEMENT AND DAMAGES, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED PATENT OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR TRADE SECRET

 *     IN THE AGREEMENT.
 * 9. GENERAL PROVISIONS
 *   9.1 By entering into the Agreement, the Customer signifies its assent to and acceptance of these UAF CLT.
 *   9.2 The License is effective from the moment of execution of the Agreement, if the Agreement does not specify later
 *     date. Where the provisions of the Agreement regarding the License and provisions of these UAF CLT differ, provisions
 *     of the Agreement shall prevail.
 *   9.3 If any provision of the Agreement regarding the License or these UAF CLT is held by a court of competent
 *     jurisdiction to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be severed from the Agreement or
 *     these UAF CLT and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
 *   9.4 The provisions of Clauses 7 and 8 shall survive any expiration or termination of the Agreement.

 *     the conflict of laws and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
 *   9.6 The resolution of all disputes arising from or connected here to shall be under sole jurisdiction of the courts of
 *     the Czech Republic.
